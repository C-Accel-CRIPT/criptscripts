# Air Force Research Lab TypeScript Script

This CRIPT Script is written in TypeScript to upload data programmatically to the
[CRIPT platform](https://criptapp.org). The [original script](../../python/AFRL.md) was written in Python,
whereas the [original Python Script](../../python/AFRL.md) was uploading nodes to [CRIPT](https://criptapp.org)
one at a time, the new TypeScript script creates a list of all nodes and uploads them to the API in one request.
