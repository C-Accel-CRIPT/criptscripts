# Air Force Research Lab Python Script

The Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Python script is a way to programmatically upload data from a
CSV file to the [CRIPT platform](https://criptapp.org). This script is written using the
[CRIPT Python SDK](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/cript), and it works by taking a row of data,
converting it to a CRIPT node, and uploading it to CRIPT one node at a time.

## Python Script

* [upload.py](./python_sdk_scripts/AFRL/upload.py)

## Supplemental File

* [requirements.txt](./python_sdk_scripts/AFRL/requirements.txt)
* [config.yaml](./python_sdk_scripts/AFRL/config.yaml)
