# use_existing Materials Example

Typically when running the [Excel Uploader](https://github.com/C-Accel-CRIPT/cript-excel-uploader) with an Excel file, it always creates new materials from each row of input. However, this raises a question of what if the material already exists within our project and we just want to add more characteristics to it? For that instance we can use the `use_existing` column withing the CRIPT Excel File. Two good example of it being used can be found below. You can learn more about the Excel Uploader `use_existing` field from the [Excel Uploader documentation](https://c-accel-cript.github.io/cript-excel-uploader/individual_sheets/).
