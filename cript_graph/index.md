# CRIPT Graphs

CRIPT Graphs are a series of diagrams depicting the relationship of CRIPT nodes and how they interact with each other.
They are also great examples that show translation of research to paper to
[CRIPT Data model](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscentsci.3c00011/suppl_file/oc3c00011_si_001.pdf).

These series of graphs have been expertly made by 
[Professor Olsen of MIT](https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/bradley-d-olsen/) for CRIPT.
