# Structure and Thermodynamics of Weakly Segregated Rod-Coil Block Copolymers

[Research paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ma062402i) 
written by Bradley D. Olsen and Rachel A. Segalman*.

The CRIPT graph has been expertly made by
[Professor Olsen of MIT](https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/bradley-d-olsen/) to serve as an example for CRIPT.
